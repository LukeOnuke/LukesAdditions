Lukes additions adds various quality of life client side improvements.

Those improvements include:
- Freecam
- Timer use
- Timer attack

# Configuration
You can change the keybinds in minecraft's keybind settings. There is currently no way to change the interval of attack
or use.

The default keybinds are:
- `KP_ADD` toggle timer use.
- `KP_ENTER` toggle timer attack.
- `MOUSE_BUTTON_1` toggle freecam.

Intervals for the timer bots are : 
- use - **0.1s 2 ticks**.
- attack - **1.5s or 30 ticks**.

# Dependencies
This mod is written for the fabric modloader and requires **fabric api**.
