Lukes additions adds various quality of life client side improvements.

Those improvements include:
- Freecam (no collision [clipping] freecam, just like spectator mode)
- Timer use
- Timer attack
- Cinematic camera mode

# Configuration
You can change the keybinds in minecraft's keybind settings. There is currently no way to change the interval of attack
or use.

The default keybinds are:
- `KP_ADD` (`keypad +`) toggle timer use.
- `KP_ENTER` (`keypad enter`) toggle timer attack.
- `KP_DECIMAL` (`keypad .`) toggle freecam.
- `KP_SUBTRACT` (`keypad -`) toggle cinematic.

Intervals for the timer bots are : 
- use - **0.1s 2 ticks**.
- attack - **1.5s or 30 ticks**.

# Dependencies
This mod is written for the fabric modloader and requires **fabric api**.
